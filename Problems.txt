1. 3 problems arised in first try about the autoload.php and missing gmp file and the version issue. (shown in 2.png and 3.png)

2.I resolved the issues and it came down to one issue i.e. version issue.(4.png)

3. So I removed my php version of 7.2.2 and installed php version of 7.1.1 as required in the command line interface.

4.But inspite of doing that the issue was not solved yet , it now wanted 7.1.3 version of php.(5.png)

So I paused here .....
Please guide me...
Thank You..
